# Pick-a-Pic

## Concept

Pick-a-Pick is a small application to pick from selections of pictures. The user searches for pictures, presents options to the intended user with a disability or language barrier, and the choice is communicated clearly using the application.

### As a Person with a Speech Disability (and/or Cognitive, Physical, etc. Disability)
```
When I see a page with images.
Then I am able to understand it easily, free of distraction.

When I touch an image.
Then the title is spoken aloud.

When a title is spoken aloud through its speech mechanics.
Then I know what the image is representing in context.

When I use the web application on a touch screen device.
Then I am able to use the screen consistently without it loosing focus if my movements were not precise.
```


### As an Educator
``` 
When I open the web application.
Then I am able to quickly produce a viable page, with images or symbols to present to my student(s).

When I utilize the search functionality.
Then I am able to choose an image for a card.

When I have finished creating my image-speech deck.
Then I am able to save the page for future use.

When I need to generate an image-speech deck quickly.
Then I am able to use one of the default templates with easy to learn mechanics.

When I am presenting this one of the pages to a student.
Then they are not capable of messing up the layout.

When I utilize this web application.
Then I am able to have it translate well on sources other than desktops, such as tablets or smart-boards.

When I generate an image card on search.
Then I am able to add a title and search term regarding the specific image.

When I open the homepage.
Then I am able to display multiple ready-made custom pages to choose from.
